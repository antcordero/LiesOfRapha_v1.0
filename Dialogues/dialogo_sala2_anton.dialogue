Anton: What are you staring at?
Marthea studies him carefully.
 She decides to test him lightly:
Marthea:
 I see you training where Rapha says you shouldn’t.  
Curious.
Anton (muttering to himself):
 “Following orders just for the sake of it makes no sense”
Marthea:
 I think you might want to help me:
 "In the Red Hall, they changed the words on a statue.
They’re hiding something. Want to discover it?"
Anton:
 “ Count me in.
Maybe we’ll die today, but it’ll be totally fun."
