Marthea stops before one of the statues.
Her eyes linger on the plaque.
[a]“Let every spirit seek the truth…”[a]
The line below feels different.
Like it was added recently
[a]“…so long as it is guided by Rapha's word.”[a]
Marthea narrows her eyes
What did it say before?
A shadow falls over the plaque.
Intructor: “Is something troubling you, Marthea?”
She straightens immediately.
Marthea: “No, Instructor.”
A brief silence.
Intructor: “Good.”
Intructor: “Faith leaves no room for doubt.”
He walks away.
Marthea looks back at the statue.
Marthea:[a]Truth should not need permission[a]
