The Red Hall is silent.
Marthea stops before a statue.
She reads the plaque
...
Marthea: “Let every spirit seek the truth…”
[a]Her fingers move lower.[/a]
Marthea: “…so long as it is guided by Rapha's word.”
...
Marthea: …This second inscription is newer.
[a]She narrows her eyes.[/a]
Marthea (thought): What did it say before?
...
[a]A shadow stretches across the stone.[/a]
