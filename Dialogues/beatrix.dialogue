Beatrix the Orator: Ah… students. Good. Listen carefully because I will not repeat this— Knowledge without direction is noise, noise becomes doubt, doubt becomes instability, and instability collapses structure.  The Titan understood that. I understand that now. Clarity is built on repetition,  and repetition refines understanding, and understanding… yes, it leads to coherence, but coherence alone is meaningless without authority, and authority without insight is chaos, and chaos… chaos is what we avoid.

Marthea (whispering to Anton): …Do we even stop her?
Anton (whispering): I… don’t think that’s an option.

Beatrix the Orator: Questioning is a tool, not a lifestyle, a lifestyle is for the misguided,  misguided who confuse volume with wisdom,  wisdom that ignores the Titan, the Titan who ensures stability,  stability that is fragile without discipline,  and discipline is… well, necessary, always necessary.  Debate is only productive when it leads somewhere,  but somewhere… somewhere must reinforce order,  order that strengthens the system,  and the system… yes, it must never falter.

Marthea (rolling her eyes): Are we… trapped in her speech forever?  
Anton (gritting teeth): Pretty sure we signed a lifetime contract… verbally.  

Beatrix the Orator: I remember discussions that went nowhere, arguments that circled endlessly, students mistaking questions for insight, and insight without clarity is just noise, and noise… ah yes, noise leads back to doubt, and doubt… oh, yes, doubt collapses structure.  

Marthea (under her breath): I need… a coffee…  
Anton: Or ten.

Beatrix the Orator: Okay, okay! Enough chatter from me. If you want my help with medicines… you must complete a Kahoot first. 
Beatrix the Orator: Answer the questions correctly… and then maybe, just maybe, I will help.

Marthea (staring): …A Kahoot?
Anton: …I didn’t see that coming.
