Marthea walks into the courtyard.
Anton trains outside, under the open sky, instead of the gym where everyone is ordered to do this.
She seems surprised.
He notices her watching.
Anton:
 “You watch a lot. Who are you?”
Marthea studies him carefully.
 She decides to test him lightly:
Marthea:
 “Don’t you think you should do this in the gym?”
Anton smirks.
Anton (muttering to himself):
 “They say we follow the rules… but who decides which ones matter?”
Marthea freezes for a moment. That’s it. Maybe he could be an ally.
 She steps closer, deciding to take the risk.
Marthea:
 “I saw the statue in the Red Hall.
 They changed the words. They hide something.”
A spark of interest appears in his eyes.
Anton:
 “Truth can be dangerous.
 Still… you want it?”
Marthea:
 “I can’t just pretend I didn’t see it.
 Please… help me find it.”
Anton:
 “Could be risky… but also will be fun.”
He falls into step beside her.
