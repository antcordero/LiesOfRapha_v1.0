Franczius the sage: (breathing deeply)
It… it’s finally over.
I can think for myself again.

Marthea:
You’re free… at last.

Franczius the sage:
Freedom… feels strange. But good.  

Marthea approaches the book. Her fingers tremble as she touches a newly revealed fragment.
Marthea:
It… it’s a Manuscript… 
The fragment hovers, glowing gently, as if calling to her.

Anton:
I can feel its power… this is no ordinary book.
Marthea lifts it carefully and flips a page.
She reads silently, eyes widening.  
Anton leans in, reading over her shoulder.
Both exchange a glance

Marthea:
We should keep searching.
Anton:
Let’s move.
