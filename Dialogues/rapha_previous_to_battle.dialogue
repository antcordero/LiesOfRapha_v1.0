[i][color=#bf4343]Small sounds: comb, bottle, an annoyed sigh.[/color][/i]
Rapha: [i][color=#bf4343]He spins around suddenly.[/color][/i]
Rapha: [i][color=#ff4747]AH![/color][/i] —Oh. It’s you. Great. Fantastic. You caught me… fixing my hair.
Marthea: [i][color=#ff4747]Wow… Rapha, your hair rituals are something else.[/color][/i] I can see why you take them so seriously. But I’m not here for that.
[i][color=#9aa0a6]She steps forward calmly.[/color][/i] We’ve seen everything, Rapha.
Rapha (dramatic): [i][color=#ff4747]EVERYTHING?[/color][/i] Even the expensive serum? Because that was an emotional investment.
Marthea: I understand that. But no. I mean… The lies, The rewritten texts, The fear.
Rapha: [i][color=#ff4747]Exactly![/color][/i] Organized. Adapted. Improved. Do you know the chaos the world would be in if people knew the truth just like that, unannounced?

[i][color=#bf4343]He approaches the mirror, pointing at it.[/color][/i]

Rapha: I wasn’t lying. I… was editing.
Marthea: Your empire was built on fear.
Rapha: [i][color=#ff4747]Because it works![/color][/i] Look around: people obey, the world turns, and my curls cooperate!

Anton: Then let it collapse.

[i][color=#9aa0a6]Marthea jumps back, startled.[/color][/i]

Marthea: [i]Whoa! That scared me![/i]
Rapha: [i][color=#ff4747]Very well.[/color][/i] If you want the truth…

[i][color=#ff4747]YOU’LL HAVE TO FIGHT FOR IT.[/color][/i]
